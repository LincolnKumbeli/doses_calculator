        <h4>b. Do a lumbar puncture if you are able to.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If the CSF is cloudy, give ceftriaxone.</li>
            <li>If you think the baby has meningitis but you are unable to get CSF or CSF is blood-stained, give ceftriaxone and refer the baby.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Is not improving after 2 days of treatment</li>
            <li>Has meningitis</li>

        <h3>PREVENTION</h3>

        <p>Many neonatal infections can be prevented by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensuring good basic hygiene and cleanliness at the delivery of the baby.</li>
            <li>Special attention to cord care (Gentian violet or 1% acriflavine in spirit application daily after clamping and cutting the cord).</li>
            <li>Breastfeeding.</li>
            <li>Giving antibiotics to babies whose mothers have fever during labour, or babies born after prolonged rupture of membranes (more than 12 hours). If these babies show no signs of sepsis after 3 days, the antibiotics can be stopped.</li>
            <li>Staff washing their hands between contact with patients.</li>

        <h3>BABIES LESS THAN 2.2KG WEIGHT</h3>

        <p>These babies need special care, but unless the baby is very ill, the safest place is with their mother. Do not separate even very small or premature babies from the mother unless absolutely necessary.</p>

        <h4>a. Keep the baby warm</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Small babies get cold easily, particularly in the highlands. Mothers should be taught how to keep these small babies warm in skin-to-skin contact via kangaroo mother care (KMC).</li>

        <h4>b. Start breast-feeds within half to 1 hour of birth</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>As much as possible, use only breast milk.</li>
            <li>Use expressed breast milk by cup if the baby cannot suck well.</li>
            <li>Use a nasogastric or gastric tube for babies less than 1.5kg and for those who are sick.</li>
            <li>Babies should be suckled on the breast before cup or tube feeds are given.</li>
            <li>When the baby is sucking well from the breast and is gaining weight above 1.8 kg, gradually reduce the cup feeds.</li>

    "Breastfeeding and nutrition":"""
        <h3>BREASTFEEDING AND NUTRITION</h3>

        <p>Breastfeeding is best!<br>
        Breast milk is safe, simple, readily available, and cheap.<br>
        It contains all the nutrients and water that the baby needs to grow.<br>
        Breastfeeding reduces the risks of diarrhoea, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, malnutrition, and other diseases.</p>

        <h4>GENERAL</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Breastfeeding should be initiated or begin within one (1) hour of birth.</li>
            <li>Skin-to-skin (or Kangaroo-mother care) should be encouraged at all deliveries to help the initiation of breastfeeding.</li>
            <li>For most babies, the easiest and best schedule is 'on-demand' breastfeeding.</li>
            <li>Infants who cannot demand feed (such as low or very low birth weight and sick babies) should be fed every 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>Infants who cannot suck on the breast (e.g., very premature, sick babies, or babies with severe cleft palate) should be given expressed breast milk (EBM) by cup or by nasogastric tube.</li>
            <li>The first yellow milk a mother makes (colostrum) should be given to the baby. It should not be thrown away. It contains nutrients and important anti-infective substances that are part of the baby's defense against infection.</li>
            <li>All babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of age. Exclusive breastfeeding means that no other foods or drinks, not even water, should be given.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>CONTINUATION OF BREASTFEEDING</h4>
        <p>Breastfeeding should continue after the introduction of nutritionally adequate local foods at 6 completed months (complementary feeds). Breastfeeding should continue for up to 24 months or more as long as it is acceptable to the mother.<br>
        Breastfeeding should be encouraged in all situations (including Emergencies and Special Situations):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Babies exposed to or infected with HIV should be encouraged to breastfeed.</li>
            <li>If the mother has died, breastfeeding by another woman can be considered after the biological father, the woman, and her husband are counselled and tested negative for HIV/AIDS.</li>
            <li>For adopted babies, breastfeeding should be encouraged after the biological parent(s) and adopting parents are counselled and tested negative for HIV/AIDS.</li>
            <li>If the baby is abandoned and the mother is not found at the time of discovery of the baby, refer to the nearest health facility and notify the Child Protection officer (child welfare) or appointed officer at the Community Development Office nearest to you for further feeding options and care.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>BREASTFEEDING POLICIES</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Breastfeeding policies should be supported, promoted, and upheld whenever possible.</li>
            <li>Baby feeding bottles with or without teats and baby cups with spouts should never be used in any health facility and should not be encouraged anywhere else. They are difficult to sterilize and often result in infections such as diarrhoea and malnutrition.</li>
            <li>Infant formula should not be encouraged to be used in health facilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>FAILURE TO BREASTFEED</h4>
        <p>If the baby fails to breastfeed:</p>
        <h5>a. Check the baby for underlying causes</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Premature or low birth weight</li>
            <li>Birth trauma</li>
            <li>Infections</li>
            <li>Congenital abnormalities e.g., cleft lip/palate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Treat the underlying cause if possible or refer to a midwife, child health nurse, paediatrician, or obstetrician.</p>

        <h5>b. Check the mother for any problems</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Maternal illness</li>
            <li>Breast problems: cracked, flat, inverted nipples</li>
            <li>Primiparous mother</li>
            <li>Adopting mother, never previously lactated</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Treat the underlying cause if possible or refer to a midwife, child health nurse, paediatrician, or obstetrician.</p>

        <h4>PROBLEMS WITH MILK SUPPLY AND BREASTFEEDING</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Check to see that the baby is properly positioned and attached at the breast during breastfeeding.</li>
            <li>Check to see whether the baby is sucking frequently and adequately.</li>
            <li>Check to see if the breast milk supply of the mother really is inadequate.</li>
            <li>If it is, give the mother:
                <ul>
                    <li>Metoclopramide (Maxolon) 10mg oral TDS (1st choice)</li>
                    <li>OR, Chlorpromazine (Largactil) 25mg oral TDS</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Continue until an adequate milk supply is established (usually within one week). Mothers given chlorpromazine should be warned that it may make them sleepy.</li>
            <li>Once the mother begins taking Maxolon or Largactil, it is essential that she is encouraged to suckle the baby as often as possible even if there is no breast milk to start with.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>REMEMBER:</strong> Breast milk is best for babies. It reduces the risk of infection and malnutrition.</p>

            <li><strong>Non-accidental injury:</strong> Any soft tissue or bony injury that is not the result of an accident.</li>
            <li><strong>Sexual abuse:</strong> Any use of a child by an adult for sexual stimulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional abuse:</strong> Undermining a child's self-esteem.</li>
            <li><strong>Neglect:</strong> Failing to provide adequate care and a safe environment for a child.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Diagnosis of Child Abuse</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Be aware that child abuse is more common than we like to think and that it presents in many different ways.</li>
            <li>Be alert to any inconsistencies in the history relating to an injury.</li>
            <li>Make a careful examination of the whole child, not just of the presenting injury.</li>
            <li>Be aware of very suggestive injuries: lower limb fractures in a child who is too young to walk, peri-orbital haematoma, unusual burn marks, multiple bruises on the back or buttocks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What to do if you suspect a child is being maltreated or neglected in any way</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Refer all cases of suspected abuse to the hospital for further assessment.</li>
            <li>Under the Lukautim Pikinini Act, health workers now have a duty to report all cases of suspected or proven abuse to their Provincial Welfare Departments.</li>
            <li>If you think a child is in danger of further abuse or injury, you should admit the child, inform the Welfare Officer as soon as possible, and ask for a protective order.</li>
            <li>Treat any physical injuries or sexually transmitted infections.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>REMEMBER:</strong> THE SAFETY, HEALTH, AND WELL-BEING OF THE CHILD IS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE. CHILD ABUSE IS EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS. NO-ONE, INCLUDING THE PARENTS, HAS THE RIGHT TO HURT A CHILD IN ANY WAY.</p>

        <h3>SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN</h3>
        <p>Sexual abuse of children is defined as the use of children by adults for sexual pleasure. It covers a range of conditions, with rape being at the severe end of the range.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, for example following a rape, the diagnosis is obvious, but many times, particularly when the abuse is chronic, the diagnosis may not be obvious.</p>
        <p>Think of sexual abuse when you see children presenting with changes in behavior or unexplained symptoms of headache or abdominal pain.</p>
        <p>Always examine the child carefully, and make sure that you have another staff member with you during the examination.</p>

        <h4>Look for:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Signs of sexually transmitted diseases.</li>
            <li>Damage to the genitalia or anus.</li>
            <li>Abnormal slackness of the anal sphincter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>In all cases of confirmed sexual abuse:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Explain to the caregiver and the child what you are doing and why.</li>
            <li>Take blood samples for HIV testing and VDRL testing.</li>
            <li>Take appropriate swabs for examination and culture if facilities are available.</li>
            <li>Treat for Sexually Transmitted Infections.</li>
            <li>Consider providing a course of prophylactic Antiretroviral treatment.</li>
            <li>Make good records both in the Child's Health Record Book and in a separate health facility record.</li>
            <li>Report the case to the Police and other relevant authorities such as the Child Welfare Department. (Sexual abuse is a mandatorily reportable condition).</li>
            <li>Make every effort to follow up on the child's condition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>RAPE</h3>
        <p>Children who have suffered rape should almost always be admitted. They need a very careful examination which might only be possible under an anaesthetic, and they may need surgical treatment in addition to vaginal and/or anal swabs being taken.</p>
        <p>Their clothing should not be washed, but should be kept in a plastic bag for possible forensic use.</p>
        <p>Child abuse - of any kind and particularly child sexual abuse - is an unpleasant matter to deal with. The natural response is to be shocked but not to get involved in trying to deal properly with the situation.</p>
        <p>Remember that if the Health Worker doesn't do the right thing, the child – and perhaps other children - will probably be abused again. It is possible to take appropriate action (e.g., in reporting the matter) as a group rather than as an individual if there are possibilities of confrontation.</p>

        <h4>i. Give the child more fluids more often to prevent dehydration:</h4>
        <p>Any locally available home fluid should be used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thin soups from boiled vegetables (e.g., rice-water, sweet potato-water, banana-water)</li>
            <li>Boiled water that has cooled or cold tea</li>
            <li>Kulau</li>

        <p>Give as much of these fluids as the child will drink, after every watery stool.</p>
        <p>Continue giving fluids until the diarrhoea stops.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Only give the mother ORS packets to mix at home if you are very sure that she can do this properly and understands how to use them.</p>

        <h3>2. Give the child plenty of food to prevent undernutrition:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Continue to breastfeed frequently.</li>
            <li>Give fresh fruit or mashed banana to provide potassium.</li>
            <li>Give freshly prepared foods. Rice, sweet potato, or taro mixed with vegetables and meat or fish are good.</li>
            <li>Cook and mash or grind food well.</li>
            <li>Encourage the child to eat; offer food at least 6 times a day.</li>
            <li>After the diarrhoea stops, give an extra meal each day for two weeks.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Reassess the child every 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>If the child is no longer dehydrated, switch to mild diarrhoea treatment.</li>
            <li>If moderate dehydration persists, continue ORS and feeding.</li>
            <li>If severe dehydration appears, switch to IV half-strength Darrow's solution.</li>
            <li>Encourage continued breastfeeding.</li>
            <li>If the child vomits: wait 10 minutes and continue giving ORS slowly.</li>
            <li>If repeated vomiting occurs: give IV HSD as for severe diarrhoea.</li>
            <li>If eyelids become puffy, stop ORS and reassess after 3 hours.</li>

        <h3>Diarrhoea Due to Cholera</h3>

        <p>Cholera is a diarrhoeal disease caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium <strong>Vibrio cholerae</strong>. About 20% of those who are infected develop acute, watery diarrhoea. 20% of these develop severe watery diarrhoea with vomiting. If these patients are not promptly and adequately treated, the loss of such large amounts of fluid and salts can lead to severe dehydration and death within hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Rehydration and replacement of electrolytes</strong> is the most important part of cholera treatment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The patient should receive different rehydration therapy (oral or intravenous fluids) depending on the dehydration severity.</li>
            <li>Use <strong>Hartmann's solution or Normal Saline</strong> for IV therapy.</li>
            <li>Oral rehydration solution (ORS) should be used during and after IV therapy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Antibiotic Treatment</h3>
        <p>Give <strong>Azithromycin 20mg/kg stat</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Confirmation and Notification of an Outbreak</h3>
        <p>Laboratory confirmation of the first 10-20 cases is essential to ascertain that this is a cholera outbreak. Take stool samples before giving antibiotics to the patient.</p>
        <p><strong>Cholera is a disease that must be notified</strong> in order to control it. Urgently notify the Provincial Disease Control Officer if you suspect a case of cholera.</p>

        <p>
            If the child is late for the first injection, give one dose for each injection due.
            For example, a child seen first at 5 months receives BCG, 1st dose of Sabin, Pentavalent, and PCV,
            and should return in one month for Measles and the 2nd dose of Sabin, Pentavalent, and PCV.
        </p>

        <h4>Previously Unvaccinated Children</h4>
        <p>
            For children under the age of 5 who have not been previously vaccinated, a full course of vaccines should be given, starting on the date when seen.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A child seen first at 5 months receives BCG, 1st dose of Sabin, Pentavalent, and PCV.</li>
            <li>Should return in one month for Measles and the 2nd dose of Sabin, Pentavalent, and PCV.</li>
            <li>Should return again after one more month for the 3rd dose of Sabin, Pentavalent, and PCV, and a single dose of IPV.</li>
            <li>An unvaccinated child of 3 years old should receive BCG, 1st dose of Sabin, Pentavalent, PCV, and MR vaccine, and return in one month for the second doses, then again after another month for the third doses and IPV.</li>
            <li>A second dose of MR vaccine should be given at some stage in the following 12 months.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Children with Incomplete Vaccination</h4>
        <p>
            Catch-up vaccination should be done so that the child completes the full immunisation schedule.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A child of two who has not received the third dose of Pentavalent, PCV, and Sabin should be given these vaccines plus a dose of IPV and MR vaccine.</li>

        <h3>HIV - Prevention of HIV Infection in Children</h3>

        <p>Almost all of the children with HIV infection have acquired the infection from their parents (through Mother to Child transmission – or more correctly Parent to Child transmission, since the mother is often infected by the father).</p>

        <p>Therefore, prevention of HIV in children is prevention of HIV in adults.</p>

        <h4>All adults should follow the basic rules of HIV prevention:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Abstinence:</strong> Don't have sex.</li>
            <li><strong>Be faithful:</strong> Have one partner who is faithful to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Use a condom:</strong> If you are sexually active, always use a condom.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is very sad if a baby is born with HIV infection – but if diagnosed early, effective treatment can be provided.</p>

        <h4>For a mother who is near 100% compliant on ART treatment:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The chances of another baby being infected are small.</li>
            <li>However, the baby should still receive ARV prophylaxis and be tested at 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li>If the mother is not compliant, there is a substantial risk that another baby will be infected.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is therefore very important to discuss this with the mother and father to make sure they understand the importance of compliance with treatment.</p>

        <h3>HIV (AIDS) IS A PREVENTABLE DISEASE.</h3>

        <p>ADVISE THE PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH HIV TO USE CONDOMS WHEN HAVING SEX AND TO SEEK TREATMENT WITH ARVs – THIS WILL AVOID FURTHER VIRUS TRANSMISSION AND PREVENT THEM FROM HAVING ANOTHER INFECTED CHILD.</p>

        <p>REMIND THE PARENTS THAT IF THEY BOTH GET ON ARVs, THEY WILL LIVE LONG AND HEALTHY LIVES, AND SO WILL THEIR BABY.</p>
    """,
    "HIV infection":"""
        <h3>HIV Infection</h3>

        <p>Children are infected by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread from a mother who is infected:
                <ul>
                    <li>Before birth (the virus crosses the placenta)</li>
                    <li>During delivery</li>
                    <li>Very soon after birth</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>By transmission in blood or by contaminated needles and syringes</li>
            <li>Uncommonly by breast feeding</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Not all babies who are born to HIV-infected mothers are infected (although all of them will be positive on the HIV screening test until the age of 15-18 months).</p>

        <h4>Does the child have at least one of the following clinical features?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Low weight for age</li>
            <li>Persistent fever (for a month or more)</li>
            <li>Enlarged lymph nodes in one or more of the following regions – neck, axillae, groin</li>
            <li>Evidence of oral candidiasis (oral thrush)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If yes:</strong> Suspect symptomatic HIV infection: <strong>TEST CHILD FOR HIV INFECTION</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>ANTIBODY TESTING IF ≥ 18 MONTHS OLD</li>
            <li>PCR DNA/RNA TESTING IF BETWEEN 6 WEEKS AND 18 MONTHS OLD</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If no:</strong> Symptomatic HIV infection unlikely.</p>

        <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
        <p>Infants and young children with 2 or more of the following should be referred for examination and screening:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Persistent diarrhoea (more than 2 weeks)</li>
            <li>Severe thrush infection</li>
            <li>Malnutrition which does not respond well to treatment</li>
            <li>Recurrent or persistent chest infections</li>
            <li>Unexplained enlargement of lymph glands</li>
            <li>TB responding poorly to treatment</li>
            <li>Persistent unexplained fever</li>
            <li>An infected parent</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If you suspect HIV, refer the child to your Medical Officer or Paediatrician.</strong></p>

        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>a.</strong> Symptomatic treatment: Treat the child's signs and symptoms with the correct standard treatment. Remember that infected children may not respond to treatment as quickly as non-infected children.</li>
            <li><strong>b.</strong> Nutrition: Give the best nutrition that you can. Monitor the child's growth.</li>
            <li><strong>c.</strong> Nursing care: Give the best nursing care you can. Children with HIV infection and their families need care, kindness, and consideration. The risks of infection to staff are very small if guidelines for nursing infected patients are followed (e.g., avoiding contact with blood and body secretions by wearing gloves).</li>
            <li><strong>d.</strong> Breastfeeding: Counsel the mother about feeding options:
                <ul>
                    <li>The baby's best chance of survival is exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months after birth, followed by the introduction of complementary feeding after six months, with breastfeeding continuing for as long as the mother wishes and is able to do so, irrespective of the mother's or baby's HIV status.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Current Evidence</h3>
        <p>Exclusive Breast Feeding (EBF) for the first six months provides the best chance of overall survival for the large majority of children, irrespective of HIV status of mother and baby.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If affordable, feasible, acceptable, sustainable, and safe (AFASS), infant formula feeding is an option, but it is less desirable for the overall health of the baby. Refer to a Medical Officer, Paediatrician, or Child Health Nurse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Immunisation</h3>
        <p>It is important to give all vaccines for children with HIV infection. However, BCG should not be given while the child is very ill. BCG should still be given to all newborns of HIV-positive mothers unless they are very ill.</p>

        <h3>Other Important Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>e.</strong> Explanation: Once the diagnosis is confirmed, explain as simply and kindly as possible about HIV infection.</li>
            <li><strong>f.</strong> Respect: Respect the patient's and family's right to confidentiality.</li>
            <li><strong>g.</strong> Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis Pneumonia: All infants of HIV-positive mothers should receive cotrimoxazole:
                <ul>
                    <li>&lt; 6 months: 2.5 ml once daily</li>
                    <li>6 months - 5 years: 5 ml once daily</li>
                    <li>6 - 14 years: 10 ml or 1 SS tab (400 SMX/80 mg TMP) once daily</li>

        <h3>Immunisation</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Always check the expiry date on the ampoule or vial and check the vial monitor.</li>
            <li>Never use vaccines that have expired.</li>
            <li>Keep all vaccines in the main compartment of the refrigerator (temperature 2-8ºC), not in the freezer. Only ice packs are kept in the freezer compartment.</li>
            <li>Use cool boiled water to clean the skin before giving an injection. Do not use alcohol or an alcohol swab.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>On Patrol</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Pack vaccines in ice in a vaccine carrier.</li>
            <li>If the ice packs have melted by the end of the day, all remaining vaccines whether opened or not should be discarded.</li>
            <li>If ice packs are still partly frozen at the end of the day, put all unopened vaccine vials back in the refrigerator and use these first at the next immunisation session.</li>
            <li>Write the date on the vials before returning them to the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Don't forget to check whether the child's brothers and sisters and mother need immunisation also.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Guidelines for Vaccine Administration</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The only vaccines ever to be withheld are pentavalent, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B if the child has a fever of more than 38ºC. (These should be given when the temperature returns to normal).</li>
            <li>You must always immunise a child even though you may have to open a new vial for only one child. Order more vaccine to make sure you have sufficient for all the children expected at the clinic plus a little extra as well.</li>
            <li>At the end of each immunisation session, return the opened Pentavalent, hepatitis B, pneumococcal, bOPV and IPV, and tetanus toxoid vials with any remaining vaccine to the refrigerator. These vaccines can be used within the next 28 days, as long as the cold chain is working and the vaccine vial monitors indicate that the vaccine is in good condition. Use the opened vials first in the next immunisation session.</li>
            <li>Discard reconstituted BCG and measles vaccines at the end of each immunisation session.</li>

        <h3>Causes and Management</h3>

        <h4>a. Sudden Onset of Swelling (Often with Fever)</h4>
        <p>Probably due to acute infection. If a neck gland is affected, check for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pus on the tonsils</li>
            <li>Pus in the ears</li>
            <li>Mouth sores or tooth infection</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Generally, any skin or wound infections will cause the proximal lymph nodes to swell.</p>

        <h4>Treatment:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Amoxicillin orally for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Cloxacillin orally for 2 weeks if cellulitis</li>
            <li>If abscess forms → Incision and drainage. Refer if necessary.</li>
            <li>If not improved after 5 days, refer to a health centre or hospital.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>b. Fixed, Hardened, Rapidly Growing Multiple Glands</h4>
        <p>May indicate a tumour. Refer to a health centre or hospital.</p>

        <h4>c. Large Glands Growing Slowly (More Than 1 Month)</h4>
        <p>Investigate for tuberculosis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Take a history of TB contact within the family</li>
            <li>Do a TB Score. Treat for TB if the score is ≥ 7</li>

            <p class="lead">Always think about meningitis or severe sepsis when you see any very sick or convulsing child.</p>

            <p>The signs of meningitis or severe sepsis are high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, severe vomiting, repeated convulsions, lethargy or unconsciousness, bulging fontanelle, severe respiratory distress, shock (weak and fast pulse, and cold hands, and capillary refill time more than 3 sec) or purpura (red or black spots on the skin).</p>

            <p>If you suspect meningitis or severe sepsis give IM or IV ceftriaxone plus treatment for severe malaria.</p>
            <p>If there are any signs of skin sepsis (boils, pustules, swollen joints) give flucloxacillin also.</p>

            <h4>EMERGENCY TREATMENT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Nurse any unconscious or convulsing child on the side and keep the airway clear.</li>
                <li>Give oxygen if there is severe respiratory distress, cyanosis or the oxygen level is <94%</li>
                <li>If the child is shocked (weak and fast pulse, and cold hands, and capillary refill time more than 3 sec), give IV Normal Saline or Hartmann's solution, a bolus of 10-20ml/kg over 30-60 minutes, then reassess.</li>
                <li>If the shock does not resolve the child will need a further bolus of 10-20ml/kg.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Investigations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Do a lumbar puncture if you can, except when the child is extremely ill. Send CSF for cell count, Gram stain, protein, sugar, and bacterial culture.</li>
                <li>Blood slide or RDT for malaria. If not available, treat for malaria.</li>
                <li>Haemoglobin.</li>
                <li>Dextrostix to check for hypoglycaemia. If unconscious or fitting give sugar under the tongue (a teaspoon of sugar with water repeated every 20 mins) or 5ml/kg 10% dextrose if the child has a drip running.</li>
                <li>Oxygen saturation (SpO2) using a pulse oximeter, if SpO2<94% give oxygen.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>1. Antibiotics</h4>
            <p>Many infections causing meningitis and severe sepsis are now resistant to chloramphenicol. Ceftriaxone is the most effective treatment for meningitis in PNG.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Give ceftriaxone 50mg/kg IM or IV twice daily for 10 days</li>
                <li>Vial of 1 gram mixed with 9.6 ml sterile water to give 1gram/ 10 ml</li>
                <li>When possible, calculate exact dose for the weight of the child, otherwise use dosing table below:</li>

            <h4>3. Early surgical incision and drainage may be important.</h4>

            <h4>TREATMENT</h4>

            <h5>1. Flucloxacillin or Cloxacillin for 4 weeks</h5>
            <p>Give IM or IV every 6 hours if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Child is very sick or</li>
                <li>Child is vomiting</li>
                <li>The child is under 3 months of age</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Otherwise give orally, suspension or capsules every 6 hours. If you do not have any flucloxacillin, give chloramphenicol at 25mg/kg per dose every 6 hours and send the child to hospital as soon as possible.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If child is not improving on flucloxacillin or chloramphenicol, refer to a paediatrician or to an orthopaedic doctor.</li>
                <li>The commonest cause of Osteomyelitis is Staphylococcus Aureus. Paediatricians should be aware there is increasing resistance to Flucloxacillin (oxacillin).</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>2. Blood transfusion</h5>
            <p>If the child is anaemic (haemoglobin less than 6.0g/dL), give a blood transfusion of packed cells if this is possible.</p>

            <h4>Investigations (to be done if possible)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Hb and WCC every 2 weeks to check for chloramphenicol toxicity.</li>
                <li>X-ray of bone — to assess progress.</li>

                <li>Use a plastic (Guedel) airway if available</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>B. Breathing</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Put oxygen or air into the lungs:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ventilation bag or</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>C. Cardiac</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Start external cardiac massage if no response to ventilation</li>
                <li>Squeeze the heart against the backbone by pressing with your hand over the sternum using:
                    <ul>
                        <li>One person: 30 compression to 2 breaths</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h4>D. Drugs</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Adrenaline — if there is no heartbeat.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mix ½ ml adrenaline 1 in 1000 with 4½ ml of water for injection. Give 1ml of this diluted adrenaline by one of the following methods:

            <h4>2. RESUSCITATION OF BABIES</h4>
            <p>Quickly dry the baby and keep him/her warm during the resuscitation.</p>

            <h4>A. Clear the airways</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>(suction, and lift the chin and pull the jaw forward).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>B. Get oxygen or air into the lungs</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a baby ventilation bag and mask or</li>
                <li>Frog breathing (using a nasal catheter and oxygen at 2-4 litres/minute) or</li>
                <li>Mouth to face resuscitation</li>
                <li>A + B are far more important than giving drugs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>C. Cardiac</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Not usually required in neonatal resuscitation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>D. Drugs – most babies do not need drugs.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Drugs are only given if the baby is not breathing on his own when he is pink and has a good pulse rate (more than 100/min) after doing Steps A and B above.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If mother has been given morphine or pethidine within four hours of delivery, give the baby:
                            <ul>
                                <li>narcan injection (0.4mg/ml) ¼ ml/kg IV or sublingually or IM.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>If no improvement, give 10% dextrose 5ml/kg IV over 5 minutes. (or 4.3% dextrose if 10% not available).</li>
                    </ul>

            <p>Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease can follow streptococcus pyogenes infection of the throat or skin. Some children present with fever and pains in the large joints that may move from one joint to another. The infection can damage the heart valves (especially the mitral and aortic valves), leading to respiratory distress and heart failure. Children with mild disease may have a heart murmur. Severe disease can present with fever, fast or difficult breathing, and lethargy. They may have chest pain or fainting. Affected children are usually over 5 years of age. Children in heart failure will have a fast heart rate, respiratory distress, and a large liver.</p>

            <h4>DIAGNOSIS</h4>
            <p>Diagnosis of rheumatic fever is very important because penicillin prophylaxis can prevent further episodes of rheumatic fever and avoid worsening damage to the heart valves.</p>
            <p>Acute rheumatic fever is diagnosed clinically (Jones criteria):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two major criteria or 1 major AND 2 minor criteria:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Major criteria: new heart murmur, polyarthritis (swelling and pain of many joints), chorea (abnormal movements), subcutaneous nodules (raised swellings in skin), erythema marginatum (red rash)</li>
                        <li>Minor criteria: fever, polyarthralgia, raised white cell count and ESR, prolonged PR interval on ECG, previous history of RF</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If available, echocardiography is useful in confirming rheumatic heart disease.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>MANAGEMENT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Admit to hospital.</li>
                <li>Aspirin (25mg per kg every 6 hours) until fever subsides then reduce dose to 12.5mg per kg every 6 hours until joint pains subsided.</li>
                <li>If in heart failure: give frusemide (1mg/kg 6 hourly), digoxin (10 microgram/kg daily) and oxygen. Check for anaemia and give a blood transfusion if the Hb < 8mg/dL.</li>
                <li>If heart failure is severe give prednisolone (1mg/kg/day) orally instead of aspirin.</li>
                <li>Give IV crystapen or amoxil orally if able to swallow.</li>
                <li>Refer to a specialist if not improving.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Follow-up care</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>All children will need ongoing antibiotic prophylaxis. Give monthly benzathine penicillin (37.5mg/kg IM, max 900mg) or daily Pen V.</li>
                <li>Ensure vaccinations are up-to-date.</li>
                <li>Review every 3-6 months.</li>

                <li>Give oxygen if available, and use an Ambu bag if patient stops breathing.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When the child is stabilized continue giving the antivenom slowly. If there are no signs of the severe reaction subsiding after 30 minutes give one more dose of diluted adrenaline intramuscularly.</p>

            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Nursing care is very important. Keep the airway clear and nurse the child in the left lateral position. Early referral of severely envenomated patients, patients who are deteriorating after antivenom, and in situations where antivenom is not available may be lifesaving. Ensure the child is nursed properly during transport.</p>

            <p>Yaws is becoming more common again in Papua New Guinea. It usually occurs in children over the age of 6 years and is most common in coastal areas.</p>

            <p>The first sign of yaws is a skin sore that is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Raised and reddish brown, with a yellow crust.</li>
                <li>Usually on the leg.</li>
                <li>Usually painless.</li>
                <li>Sometimes ulcerated.</li>
                <li>Unresponsive to standard sore treatments.</li>
                <li>Heals slowly over a few months.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Later, many children develop bony problems. These usually start with chronic pain in the long bones and swellings of the fingers, forearms, legs, and bridge of the nose. The skin sore may have healed by this stage. The VDRL test is positive.</p>
