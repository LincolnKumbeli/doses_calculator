        <h4>b. Do a lumbar puncture if you are able to.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If the CSF is cloudy, give ceftriaxone.</li>

            <li>Is not improving after 2 days of treatment</li>
            <li>Has meningitis</li>
            <li>Is severely jaundiced (deep yellow or orange colour)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>PREVENTION</h3>

        <p>Many neonatal infections can be prevented by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensuring good basic hygiene and cleanliness at the delivery of the baby.</li>
            <li>Special attention to cord care (Gentian violet or 1% acriflavine in spirit application daily after clamping and cutting the cord).</li>
            <li>Breastfeeding.</li>
            <li>Giving antibiotics to babies whose mothers have fever during labour, or babies born after prolonged rupture of membranes (more than 12 hours). If these babies show no signs of sepsis after 3 days, the antibiotics can be stopped.</li>
            <li>Staff washing their hands between contact with patients.</li>

        <h3>BABIES LESS THAN 2.2KG WEIGHT</h3>

        <p>These babies need special care, but unless the baby is very ill, the safest place is with their mother. Do not separate even very small or premature babies from the mother unless absolutely necessary.</p>

        <h4>a. Keep the baby warm</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Small babies get cold easily, particularly in the highlands. Mothers should be taught how to keep these small babies warm in skin-to-skin contact via kangaroo mother care (KMC).</li>
            <li>If KMC is not possible, keep the baby well wrapped up in a warm room, lying cuddled up to the mother.</li>
            <li>If the baby is too sick to be with the mother, it may be necessary to keep the baby warm with well-covered hot water bottles or bags, but be very careful not to burn the baby.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>b. Start breast-feeds within half to 1 hour of birth</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>As much as possible, use only breast milk.</li>
            <li>Use expressed breast milk by cup if the baby cannot suck well.</li>
            <li>Use a nasogastric or gastric tube for babies less than 1.5kg and for those who are sick.</li>
            <li>Babies should be suckled on the breast before cup or tube feeds are given.</li>
            <li>When the baby is sucking well from the breast and is gaining weight above 1.8 kg, gradually reduce the cup feeds.</li>
